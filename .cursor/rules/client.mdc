# Rules for client folder

- Entities shared between server and client must be declared and used directly from shared
- System design must be used in all layouts
- You must ensure good code readability by always using clean code.
- Component reading complexity should be low, breaking components down into their unique responsibilities
- The use of states like useState should only have one per component, if you need more state variables create an object in useState
- Component performance is crucial, so data structures should be used strategically, such as Set Map or even the tree concept.
- Ternaries should be avoided
- Conditionals should always happen with declarative variables
- All client-facing text must use multi-language architecture

# Rules for server folder

- Entities shared between server and client must be declared and used directly from shared
- You should consider using decorators when it makes sense to simplify the logic and understanding of the code for future maintenance.
- You should always use the current system architecture as a basis.
- The project does not use nestJs, only express and custom decorators.
